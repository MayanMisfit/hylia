I don't know why I wrote this, it just happened ok 

I am he who bends \
his will to ensure \
your dreams are sweet \
and true 

So come my love \
come dream with \
me and we shall \
dance in the \
heavens amongst \
the stars so bright \
this glorious night 

We shall dance sun \
we shall dance \
the moon 

So come my beloved \
come, come, come \
dream with me \
and we shall dance \
the dance of \
lovers this glorious \
night.
