I found this fairly Amusing, taken from the foot of an email from the Ask Molly Newsletter. 
<blockquote>

Yes, you can enjoy this fucked up day. Yes you can. <br>

No, you’re wrong. You can enjoy it.<br>

Yes you can, asshole. <br>

You can. What would it take?<br> 

Ask yourself what it would take to enjoy this day.<br> 

Do the one thing you can do. The one thing.<br>

Do it now, stupid. Go ahead. <br>

It’s fine. You deserve this. You do. Yes, you do. Yes. You do.<br>
